# What this project is about?

The idea is to have a minimal setup for experimenting with html + css + tailwindcss.

We use Eleventy, TailwindCSS and some cool small javascript tools to wire all together for maximum developer happiness.

## Installation

mkdir tailwind
cd tailwind
yarn init
yarn add tailwindcss postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer @11ty/eleventy concurrently -D
create postcss.config.js
npx tailwindcss init
install Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Visual Code Plugin + Restart VC
